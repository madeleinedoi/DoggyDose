            <p class="recipe-name">Christmas Treats</p>
            <pre>
                Ingredients:

                    1 medium ripe banana
                    2 large carrots, grated
                    50g applesauce, unsweetened
                    30ml water (you may need to add an additional 30ml)
                    200g whole wheat flour
                    85g rolled oats

                Instructions:

                    1. Preheat oven to 175°C. Line two large baking trays with greaseproof paper.

                    2. Mash the ripe banana in a small bowl, grate the carrots, and mix with the banana.

                    3. Add the applesauce and 30ml of water to the banana and carrot mix.

                    4. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and oats. Make a well in the centre of the dry ingredients and pour in the carrot mixture.

                    5. Stir until thoroughly combined then knead the dough in the bowl with your hands. You can add the remaining 30ml of water if needed to combine all the ingredients.

                    6. Roll out to 1.5cm thickness, then cut into shapes using cookie cutters – a Christmas tree or gingerbread man would suit the season, or a good old bone shape. Arrange on the baking sheets.

                    7. Bake for 25 minutes. Allow to cool completely before serving.

                    8. Store at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. Or keep them in the freezer for up to 6 months.
