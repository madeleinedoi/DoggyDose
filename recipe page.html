</p> Peanut Butter, Banana and Yogurt Popsicles </p>

<pre>
    1. Begin by mixing 18 ounces of plain nonfat yogurt -- make it healthy for your pup.

    2. Then, add half a cup of peanut butter and stir until the peanut butter blends with the yogurt.

    3. Now, mix in a four-ounce jar of banana baby food, making it much easier to blend into the peanut butter and yogurt than a smashed banana.

    4. Finally, sweeten the popsicle blend with one tablespoon of honey and stir until everything is smooth and creamy.

    5. Fill a small plastic cup to the top with the popsicle mix and stick a dog bone half way into the mixture to serve as the handle

    6. Stick the popsicles in the freezer and wait until completely frozen to serve to your dog.

    7. Enjoy!!</pre>
