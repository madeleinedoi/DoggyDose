</p> Pumpkin Spice Doggy Cake!</p>




</p> Peanut Butter, Banana and Yogurt Popsicles </p>
<pre>Begin by mixing 18 ounces of plain nonfat yogurt -- make it healthy for your pup.
    Then, add half a cup of peanut butter and stir until the peanut butter blends with the yogurt.

    Now, mix in a four-ounce jar of banana baby food, making it much easier to blend into the peanut butter and yogurt than a smashed banana.

    Finally, sweeten the popsicle blend with one tablespoon of honey and stir until everything is smooth and creamy.

    Fill a small plastic cup to the top with the popsicle mix and stick a dog bone half way into the mixture to serve as the handle

    Stick the popsicles in the freezer and wait until completely frozen to serve to your dog.

    Enjoy!!</pre>
